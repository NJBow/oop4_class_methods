# Class methods

## Learning objectives

- Understand that class method belongs to a class object
- Understand how class methods are used in the Builder pattern
- Understand how class methods are used to persist information
- Understand why class methods should not be overused

## Assignment

- Investigate object properties of classes in `pry`;
- Read through `team.rb`. Understand the usage of the class method as Builder;
- Implement `build` method in the `Team` class to build a team from a list of players. The method should validate passed arguments: a roller derby team should have a jammer and 4 blockers one of whom is a pivot;
- Refactor the `Team` class to store team name in a class method;
